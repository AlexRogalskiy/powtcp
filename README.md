# powtcp

This project is a simple example of [Proof of work (PoW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) protected TCP server. It implements chellenge-response protocol and uses [hashcash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash) algorithm.

## Protocol

The server and client communicate using an internal messaging protocol. Each message ends with the `\n` character. It's used to separeate messages from each other.

A message consists of a command and a payload. They are separated by the `:` character. The payload can be any string without `\n` character. It's not very convenient, but there are no conflicts related to the `\n` character in this project.
